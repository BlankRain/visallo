# Dependencies

Setting up a Visallo development environment is very similar across Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux platforms and requires only a few dependencies to get started. The only required dependencies to get started are a [Java 8 JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html), [Git](http://git-scm.com/), and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org), . Please see the documentation for each respective project for installation instructions.
