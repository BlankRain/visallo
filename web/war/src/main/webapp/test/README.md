# Jest (React, future)

Jest is the preferred testing framework for new tests since they are much faster. They won't/can't run in the browser. Use ES2015 import syntax to write tests.

To run jest tests

        webapp$ yarn jest
        webapp$ yarn jest-watch

# Unit Tests (Legacy karma+mocha+chai)

To run unit tests

        webapp$ yarn test
        webapp$ yarn test-watch
