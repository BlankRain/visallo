# Sandboxing and Publishing

A core featue of {{ book.productName }} is that users can [Colaborate](colaboration.md)
with each other within the safety of a sandboxed
[Workspace](workspaces.md) allowing them to explore added and changed
data without impacting all user of the system.

Users with the `PUBLISH` [Privilege](privilages.md) can promote data
from the sandbox to be seen by all users (limited by [Data Access
Control](data-access-control.md))
